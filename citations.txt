What I asked?:
- I have an array of TeamInfo objects with city, team name, and year founded.
My only current method gives a true of false if teams have the same founding year.
How can I think about starting and beginning a method that finds all teams with the oldest founding year and returns them?

What response I recieved:
- 
1. Find the oldest year
Look at every team and figure out which founding year is the earliest

    2. Count how many teams have that oldest year
    Go through each team and count how many match the oldest year so we know how big our result array should be
    
        3. Create an array for the oldest teams
            Make a container just big enough to hold all the oldest teams
            
            4. Fill the array with the oldest teams
                Go through all the teams again, and put each team with the oldest year into our container, one by one
                
                5. Return the array
                    Give back all the teams that are tied for oldest, so the program can print or use them
